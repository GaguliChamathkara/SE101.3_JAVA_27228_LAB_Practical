    //Output is Undergraduate class can not inherit from the student class and in student class it is missing method body or declare abstract.
    //Reason for this is we use the keyword called "final". Final keyword means if we do not want other classes to inherit from a class.
    //The other reason is that, the method body or the declaration of abstract is missing.
